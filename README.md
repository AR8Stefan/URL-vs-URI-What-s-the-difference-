### Understanding the differences between URLs &amp; URIs

# URL vs URI, what's the difference?
The acronyms URL and URI are often used interchangeably. Although they can be referencing the same thing, there are some distinctions. Here is a brief summary:

* URI stands for "Uniform Resource Identifier", the keyword being "Identifier". This can mean name, location, or both.
Example: /api/v1/games/1234

* URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator", the keyword being "Locator" so it provides full details to locate the resource.
Example: https://teamtreehouse.com/stefanpiatkov

The part that makes something a URL is the combination of the name and an access method, such as https://, or mailto:.
URLs are URIs, but the opposite is not true. So saying URI is always technically accurate, but if you are discussing something that’s both a full URL and a URI (which all URLs are), it’s best to call it a “URL” because it’s more specific.
